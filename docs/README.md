## Purpose

There is a lot of multi-purpose bots out there, some of them may also include a simple counting setup. What's wrong about multi-purpose is that they're on focused on so many things that some of the features are poorly executed and very limited. Countr is not multi-purpose, it's only focused on counting. This means Countr has much more counting features than other bots. Countr has a simple setup but also has cool advanced features, such as modules, rewards and more.
