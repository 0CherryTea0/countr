### Before you start

Please read this, or you might have to restart! All the strings are in one file, we'll use `en.json` for now.

- In simple strings, you shall only translate the YELLOW highlighted text [in this reference-image](https://i.imgur.com/rJCyUwN.png). The RED highlighted text is what we call a placeholder, you shall NEVER translate this, but you can move it around so it makes sense.
- In command descriptions, you shall only translate the highlighted text [in this reference-image](https://i.imgur.com/iCo8M5k.png).
- If the command requires a special input, such as in [c!addrole (marked in RED)](https://i.imgur.com/wOPsAlV.png), you shall NEVER translate this as it will confuse the user.
- If the command's example requires a custom string to be used, such as in [c!topic (marked in RED)](https://i.imgur.com/YJwQacH.png), you can translate this to match your language.
